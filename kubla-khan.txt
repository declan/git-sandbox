In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree
Where Alph the sacred river ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were circled round
And there were gardens, bright with sinuous rills
Where flowered many an incense bearing tree
And there were forests ancient as the hills
Enclosing sunny spots of greenery.

But oh! That deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down a green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermittent burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood an dale the sacred river ran
Then reached the caverns measurelss to man
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean.
And mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
The shadow of the dome of pleasure
Floated midway on the waves
Where was heard the mingled measure
From the fountains and the caves.
It was a miracle or rare device
A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice!

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw
She was Abyssinian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played,
Singing of Mount Abora.
Could I revive within me her symphony and song
To such a great delight t'would win me
That with music loud and long
I would weave that dome in air
That sunny dome, those caves of ice!
And all who heard would see them there
And all would cry Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes in holy dread,
For he on honeydew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of paradise.
