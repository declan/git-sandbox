My soul is like an enchanted boat
Which like a sleeping swan doth float
Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing
And thine doth like an angel sit
Beside the helm conducting it
Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing.
It seems to float forever, ever,
Upon that many-winding river,
Between mountains, woods, abysses,
A paradise of wildernesses!
Til, like one in slumber bound
Borne to the ocean, I float down, around
Into a sea profound, of ever spreading sound.
