My soul is like an enchanted boat
Which lke a sleeping swan doth flaot
Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing
And thine doth like an angel sit
beside the helm conducting it
Whilst all the winds with melody are ringing

It seems to float forever, ever
Upon this many winding river
Until, as one in slumber bound
Borne to the ocean, I float down
Around, into an ever spreading sea of sound.
