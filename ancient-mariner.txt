It is an ancient mariner
And he stopeth one of three
"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?

"The bridegroom's doors are open wide
And I am next of kin.
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May'st hear the merry din!"

He holds him with his withered hand,
"There was a ship", quoth he
"Hold off, unhand me grey-beard loon!"
Eftsoon his hand drops he.

He holds him with his glittering eye
The wedding guest stands still
And listens like a three-year child
The mariner hath his will.

The ship was cheered, The harbor cleared
Merrily did we drop
Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the lighthouse top.
